A simple Express app designed to provide a basic API for our code test.

### Quick start

1. [Install node](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
> Recommended version >= 6.x

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies

1. Run `npm run migrate` to migrate your development database

1. Run `npm run seed` to seed your development database

1. Run `npm start` to start up the local development server

You should get JSON output from http://localhost:3000/members

### Testing

### Todo
